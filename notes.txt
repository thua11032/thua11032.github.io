Jeff Yang:
Tony Hua stands out as a self-starting leader who has beat the odds. Despite growing up in a community riddled with gang activity and homelessness, he found compassion from his situation and turned his family’s struggles into motivation to become a successful engineer. From teaching himself to fix salvaged electronics to creating and funding a new engineering program at his high school, Tony has been proactive about pursuing his goals while also helping others.

Tony led his school engineering team to a first place win in the 2012 Solar Boat Project competition. He is well on his way to becoming an impressive scientist, having interned with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the UC Davis Ross Laboratory, as well as learning multiple scripting languages and software. In addition to all this, Tony has kept up stellar grades in all areas, and served as Captain of the varsity tennis team. We know Tony will make incredible contributions to society and his community, and we are delighted to invest in his future.
